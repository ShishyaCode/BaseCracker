# BaseCracker

🔐 **BaseCracker** is a powerful Python decoder tool designed to uncover hidden data inside scripts! It detects and decodes base64/base85 strings, zlib-compressed content, and even embedded ZIP archives — making it perfect for reverse engineering, malware analysis, or just exploring encoded files.

🚀 With **Telegram bot integration**, you can easily send decoded results straight to your Telegram chat for quick access on any device.

⛔️ **Note:**  
BaseCracker works as a *manual decoder*, so complex files with multiple encoding layers might require decoding more than once. Errors can occur if the input isn’t perfectly formatted.

## How to Use

Run it in your terminal (Termux, CMD, or any shell):

```bash
python BaseCracker.py
